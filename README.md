# Cricket Data Visualization Project

## Overview
This project is an extensive analysis of Indian cricket tournaments, including the IPL, Ranji Trophy, and Asia Cup. Using Tableau, I have visualized key aspects such as match outcomes, player statistics, and the impact of the IPL on other tournaments.

## Objectives
- **Analyze match outcomes of IPL teams:** Head-to-head analysis, venue popularity, and team performances.
- **Investigate the effect of the toss on match results:** Decisions post-toss and their impact on match outcomes.
- **Evaluate player performance:** Consistency, top scorers, and player distribution across IPL seasons.
- **Assess IPL's impact on Ranji players:** Statistical comparison of pre- and post-IPL performance.
- **Examine IPL’s influence on Asia Cup:** Analyzing India's performance in the Asia Cup before and after the IPL's inception.

## Data Sources
- [IPL Auction Data (2013-2022)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sidharthkriplani/ipl-auction-data-from-20132022)
- [Ranji Data](https://data.world/mkhuzaima/ipl-data-till-2017)
- [Asia Cup Data](https://data.world/dkmohnaty/cricket-world-cup-winners/workspace/file?filename=Asia+Cup+Winners.xlsx)

## Key Visualizations
1. **Match Outcomes Analysis:**
   - Matches played by each team across seasons
   - Popularity of venues and their impact on match results
2. **Toss Effect Analysis:**
   - Toss decisions and match outcomes
   - Most common decisions post-toss and their success rates
3. **Player Performance Analysis:**
   - Player distribution across teams
   - Top scorers and Man of the Match award winners
   - Players with the best strike rates
4. **Ranji Trophy Analysis:**
   - Correlation of runs scored and runs conceded by players in different seasons
5. **Asia Cup Performance Analysis:**
   - India’s runs scored and match outcomes before and after IPL

## Conclusion
The analysis demonstrates the significant impact of the IPL on Indian cricket, enhancing player skills and influencing match outcomes 
in domestic and international tournaments. While various factors contribute to match results, the IPL has undeniably elevated the level of Indian cricket.

## Future Work
Further exploration into:
- Comparing IPL vs. international player performances
- Analyzing men's vs. women's cricket statistics
- Evaluating IPL's influence on cricket development in other countries
